## 🧠 Critical Reflections  

As a professional financial analyst and data scientist, my aim is not just to analyze data, but to **illuminate patterns that drive real business value**. In this project:

- I used **Power BI’s advanced DAX modeling** to extract KPIs, trends, and time-based comparisons that mirror financial reporting structures.
- The dashboard's dynamic filters enable multi-level **drilldowns by time, geography, and product line**, providing a CFO-level summary down to day-to-day store performance.
- The layout simulates a **BI tool for corporate decision-makers**, with strategic use of color, whitespace, and narrative visual flow.

**Key Insights from the Dashboard:**

- 🔺 Sales increased **+31.8% month-over-month**, with **48,233 units sold** and **$156,728** in revenue.
- 🏙️ Top-performing locations: *Astoria*, *Hell’s Kitchen*, and *Lower Manhattan*.
- ☕ Product leaders: Coffee ($60.3K), Barista Espresso ($20.4K), and Tea ($44.5K).
- 📆 74% of total sales occurred on **weekdays**, highlighting commuter-driven revenue trends.
- 🕒 **Hourly heatmaps** reveal peak buying windows between **10 AM – 2 PM**.

> This project demonstrates my capability to merge **financial acumen**, **data analytics**, and **visual communication**—a core requirement for today’s data-driven business environments.
